        Each item of this third two-page questionnaire is a statement that a person may either agree with or
        disagree with. For each item, indicate how much you agree or disagree with what the item says. Please be as
        accurate and honest as you can be. You are asked to rate the statements on a 4-point scale, ranging from
        completely disagreeing to completely agreeing with the statement.
