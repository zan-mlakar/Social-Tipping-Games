    <p>
        In this second questionnaire, you can find some statements inquiring about how important social contacts with
        others are to you and how consistent you try to be in life. For each item, indicate how much you agree or
        disagree with what the item says. You are asked to rate the statements on a 7-point scale, ranging from
        strongly disagreeing to strongly agreeing with the statement.
