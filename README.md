INSTRUCTIONS

The game is built in python using the oTree platform. See https://otree.readthedocs.io for all the details on accessing and adjusting the code as well as for deploying the game.

ORGANISATION

The folders 'thesis_intro', 'thesis_game', and 'thesis-scales' contain the different applications that make up the full experiment. Specifically, they
contain the instructions, experimental game, and individual characteristics measures, respectively. The folder '_static' contains the different images
and other similar resources used in the experiment. The file 'settings.py' allows one to manage the set-up of the different (demo) sessions, sequencing
of apps, admin settings etc.

LICENSE

Built on fully open-source platform, no licenses required. However, note that whenever the game is used for the purposes of (scientific) research,
paper https://doi.org/10.1086/731916 should be cited as the source of the
experimental game and paper https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbef.2015.12.001 as
the source of the oTree infrastructure on which the game is built.
