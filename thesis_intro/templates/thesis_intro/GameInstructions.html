    <p>
        You and the other participants surrounding you are employees at a start-up company that is developing two <b>New
        Products: Tao and Eta</b>. Only one of the New Products will be released to the public. Your task is to collectively
        decide which New Product to release through multiple rounds of interaction. In each round, you can
        <b>personally endorse one of the New Products</b> (see the screenshot below).
    </p>
    <p><br>

    <br></p>
    <p>
        In each round, after all employees endorse one of the New Products, everyone will be able to see <b>the percentage
        of employees </b> and <b>the nicknames of employees</b> that endorsed each of the New Products in the current
        round (see the screenshot below). In order for one of the New Products to be released, it needs unanimous
        endorsement. <b>This means that the task continues until the round in which all employees endorse the same
        New Product.</b> If after 24 rounds there is still no full agreement on which New Product to release, none of
        the New Products gets released.

    <p style="text-transform: uppercase"><b>
        Please note that, during the game, you are not allowed to physically or verbally communicate with other
        participants in any way as it could influence the results. Doing so will result in immediate exclusion from

    <p style="text-align: center"><i><b>Instructions 2/3: Game point system and payoffs</b></i></p>
    <p>
        The financial payoff you receive at the end of the study is split in two parts. First, you receive a fixed payoff
        of 4€ OR 4 research points for your participation (depending on what you participate for). Second, you can receive
        up to 4€ bonus depending on the amount of GC (game currency) you earn in the game (1 GC = 0,25€). The amount of
        GC you earn in the game depends on two things: <i>the revenue generated by the released New Product</i> and
        <i>the amount of shares of the released New Product you own</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The revenue that is generated by the released New Product is determined based on the amount of rounds it takes
        your company to launch the product. <b>With every additional round</b>, the novelty of the product wears off and
        <b>the generated revenue decreases</b> (see table below). The generated revenue calculation is made for a group
        of 16 employees and adjusted proportionally for smaller groups. However, in all cases, note that if you <b>do not
        reach a consensus</b>, no New Product gets released and <b>all employees receive 0 GC</b>.
    </p>
    <br><table class="table">
        <tr><th>Round number</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>...</td>
            <td>24</td><td><b>No release</b></td></tr>
        <tr><th>Generated revenue if a New Product is released in this round</th><td>240 GC</td><td>235 GC</td><td>230 GC</td>
            <td>225 GC</td><td>220 GC</td><td>215 GC</td><td>...</td><td>120 GC</td><td><b>0 GC</b></td></tr>
        <tr><th></th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        The amount of shares of the released New Product you own at the end of the game depends on how often you endorsed it. <b>For every round
        in which you endorse a New Product</b> (for example Tao), you <b>receive one share of that specific New Product</b> (Tao).
        The proportion of shares of the released New Product you own at the end of the game determines the portion of its generated
        revenue you receive.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        To make sure you understand the instructions, let us take a look at an example. In the table below, you may see
        the outcome of three people that engaged in the described task. The amount of GC each of them earns is determined as
        follows. First, since all employees endorsed Tao in Round 5 (marked green), <i>Tao is the New Product that gets released</i>. Second,
        since Tao is <i>released in Round 5, it generates a revenue of 220 GC</i>. Third, in total, 10 shares of Tao were issued:
        Lotte got 5 shares, Jesse got 4 shares, and Otto got 1 share. Therefore, Lotte receives 50% of the generated revenue,
        Jesse 40%, and Otto 10%. Translated into GC, Lotte receives 110 GC, Jesse receives 88 GC and Otto receives 22 GC.
    </p>
    <br><table class="table" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">
    <tr><td>Round number</td><td>Lotte's endorsements</td><td>Jesse's endorsements</td><td>Otto's endorsements</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>Tao</td><td>Eta</td><td>Eta</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Tao</td><td>Tao</td><td>Eta</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Tao</td><td>Tao</td><td>Eta</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>Tao</td><td>Tao</td><td>Eta</td></tr>
    <tr style="color: limegreen"><td>5</td><td>Tao</td><td>Tao</td><td>Tao</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GC awarded</td><td>110</td><td>88</td><td>22</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
